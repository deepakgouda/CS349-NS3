# NS3 Simulation
## Studying Congestion window of TCP versions, packets dropped and bytes sent under TCP and Constant Bit Rate traffic

NS3 version 3(dev)
 - Place ```script.cc``` in scratch folder
 - Place ```run_script.sh``` in ns3 folder.
 - Run with command
	```bash run_script.sh```
 - Place ```script.py``` in ns3 folder and run it to view plots.

Output:
Cumulative Bytes Transferred vs Time:
